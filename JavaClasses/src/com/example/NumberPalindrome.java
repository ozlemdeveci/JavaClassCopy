	//Write a program to check the number is palidrome. Use Scanner to input values
	///Example Input/Output:
	//1221    Number is a palindrome
	//4554    Number is a palindrome
	//1121    Number is not a palindrome (because reverse is 1211 and that is not equal
	//to 1121 A palindrome number is a number which reversed equal to the original number. 
	//For example 121, 12321, 1001 etc
	//Logic to check a palindrome number:
	//Find the reverse of the given number. Store it in some variable say -reverse-. 
	//Compare the -number- with -reverse-.
	//If both are the same then then number is a palindrome otherwise it is not
	//Logic to reverse a number:
	//Declare and initialize another variable to store the reverse of a number, 
	//for example reverse = 0.
//	Extract the last digit of the given number by performing the modulo division
	//(remainder).
//	Store the last digit to some variable sat lastDigit = num % 10.
	//Increase the place value of reverse by one.
	//To increase place value multiply the reverse variable by 10 e.g.
	//reverse = reverse * 10.
	//Add lastDigit to reverse.
	//Since the last digit of the number is processed, remove the 
	//last digit of num. To remove the last digit dibide number by 10. 
	//Repeat steps until number is not equal to (or greater than) zero.
